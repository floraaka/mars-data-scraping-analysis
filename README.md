# Mars Data Scraping and Analysis

This project involves web scraping data from various Mars-related websites and performing analysis on the scraped data. The project is divided into two main parts: scraping Mars news articles and scraping Mars weather data. The results are stored, analyzed, and visualized using Python libraries such as Splinter, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas.

## Project Overview
Part 1: Scrape Mars News
In this part, we scrape the latest Mars news articles from the NASA Mars News Site. The objective is to extract the titles and preview text of recent articles and store them in a structured Python data format (list of dictionaries).

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
In this part, we scrape Mars weather data from the Mars Weather Data Site. The scraped data includes information such as the Martian date (sol), minimum temperature, and atmospheric pressure. The dataset is then cleaned and analyzed to extract key insights.

## Key Findings:
Coldest Month: Martian Month 3, with an average minimum temperature of -83.31°C.
Hottest Month: Martian Month 8, with an average minimum temperature of -68.38°C.
Month with the Lowest Pressure: Martian Month 6, with an average atmospheric pressure of 745.05 Pa.
Month with the Highest Pressure: Martian Month 9, with an average atmospheric pressure of 913.31 Pa.
Approximate Martian Year Length: 3 Earth years (based on temperature patterns).
The data is visualized in graphs and exported to a CSV file for further use.
